Tech Stack:

- Swift: The primary programming language used for building the application.
- UIKit: Framework for building the user interface.
- Auto Layout: Ensures adaptive UI that works on various device sizes and orientations.
- Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA): Allows for modular development and easier maintenance by separating different functionalities into services.
- Model-View-Presenter (MVP): This pattern is used for better separation of concerns, where the Presenter handles the logic and prepares data for the View.
- Coordinators: Helps in managing navigation and flow throughout the application, making the codebase cleaner and easier to understand.
- Grand Central Dispatch (GCD): Utilized for efficient handling of concurrent tasks and ensuring smooth user interface updates without blocking the main thread.
